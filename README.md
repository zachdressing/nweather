##Remake the Weather API App in Next.JS
#Peer Reviewer: Elizabeth Trotter
#Peer Review: Tested and weather application functions well. The search and favorites work as intended. One small suggestion is to remove the seconds from the time since the time is not currently being rendered every second. Overall, great work Zach!
